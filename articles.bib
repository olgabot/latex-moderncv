  abstract = "The biological interpretation of gene lists with interesting
              shared properties, such as up- or down-regulation in a particular
              experiment, is typically accomplished using gene ontology
              enrichment analysis tools. Given a list of genes, a gene ontology
              (GO) enrichment analysis may return hundreds of statistically
              significant GO results in a ``flat'' list, which can be
              challenging to summarize. It can also be difficult to keep pace
              with rapidly expanding biological knowledge, which often results
              in daily changes to any of the over 47,000 gene ontologies that
              describe biological knowledge. GOATOOLS, a Python-based library,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Most data on the clinical presentation, diagnostics,
              and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 have been presented as
              case series without comparison to patients with other acute
              respiratory illnesses. METHODS: We examined emergency department
              patients between February 3 and March 31, 2020 with an acute
              respiratory illness who were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We determined
              COVID-19 status by PCR and metagenomic next generation sequencing
              (mNGS). We compared clinical presentation, diagnostics,
              treatment, and outcomes. FINDINGS: Among 316 patients, 33 tested
              positive for SARS-CoV-2; 31 without COVID-19 tested positive for
              another respiratory virus. Among patients with additional viral
              testing (27/33), no SARS-CoV-2 co-infections were identified.
              Compared to those who tested negative, patients with COVID-19
              reported longer symptoms duration (median 7d vs. 3d, p < 0.001).
              Patients with COVID-19 were more often hospitalized (79\% vs.
              56\%, p = 0.014). When hospitalized, patients with COVID-19 had
              longer hospitalizations (median 10.7d vs. 4.7d, p < 0.001) and
              more often developed ARDS (23\% vs. 3\%, p < 0.001). Most
              comorbidities, medications, symptoms, vital signs, laboratories,
              treatments, and outcomes did not differ by COVID-19 status.
              INTERPRETATION: While we found differences in clinical features
              of COVID-19 compared to other acute respiratory illnesses, there
              was significant overlap in presentation and comorbidities.
              Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to the
              hospital, have longer hospitalizations and develop ARDS, and were
              unlikely to have co-existent viral infections. FUNDING: National

  abstract = "An estimated 2 billion species of microbes exist on Earth with
              orders of magnitude more strains. Microbial pangenomes are
              created by aggregating all genomes of a single clade and reflect
              the metabolic diversity of groups of organisms. As de novo
              metagenome analysis techniques have matured and reference genome
              databases have expanded, metapangenome analysis has risen in
              popularity as a tool to organize the functional potential of
              organisms in relation to the environment from which those
              organisms were sampled. However, the reliance on assembly and
              binning or on reference databases often leaves substantial
              portions of metagenomes unanalyzed, thereby underestimating the
              functional potential of a community. To address this challenge,
              we present a method for metapangenomics that relies on amino acid
              k-mers (kaa-mers) and metagenome assembly graph queries. To
              enable this method, we first show that kaa-mers estimate
              pangenome characteristics and that open reading frames can be
              accurately predicted from short shotgun sequencing reads using
              the previously developed tool orpheum. These techniques enable
              pangenomics to be performed directly on short sequencing reads.
              To enable metapangenome analysis, we combine these approaches
              with compact de Bruijn assembly graph queries to directly
              generate sets of sequencing reads for a specific species from a
              metagenome. When applied to stool metagenomes from an individual
              receiving antibiotics over time, we show that these approaches
              identify strain fluctuations that coincide with antibiotic

              in the accompanying paper we used large-scale single cell
              RNA-sequencing of 27 organs and tissues to identify over 750
              molecular cell types and their full transcriptomic profiles. Here
              we use this extensive transcriptomic dataset to uncover thousands
              of previously unidentified genes and hundreds of thousands of new
              splice junctions in the reference genome that globally define
              lemur gene structures and cell-type selective expression and
              splicing and to investigate gene expression evolution. We use the
              atlas to explore the biology and function of the lemur immune
              system, including the expression profiles across the organism of
              all MHC genes and chemokines in health and disease, and the
              mapping of neutrophil and macrophage development, trafficking,
              and activation, their local and global responses to infection,

              dramatic seasonal rhythms, and spontaneous metastatic endometrial

              disease. Thus, an organism-wide molecular cell atlas and

                 Rhinolophus sinicus ), where we propagated cellular
                 compartment labels at high fidelity. Our pipeline provides a
                 high-throughput tool that enables analyses of transcriptomic
                 data across divergent species' transcriptomes in a genome- and
                 gene annotation-agnostic manner. Thus, the combination of
                 Kmermaid and Orpheum identifies cell type-specific sequences
                 that may be missing from genome annotations and empowers
                 molecular cellular phenotyping for novel model organisms and
                 species. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have
