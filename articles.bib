	abstract = {Background: Emerging data on the clinical presentation, diagnostics, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 have largely been presented as case series. Few studies have compared these clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 to other acute respiratory illnesses. Methods: We examined all patients presenting to an emergency department in San Francisco, California between February 3 and March 31, 2020 with an acute respiratory illness who were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We determined COVID-19 status by PCR and metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). We compared demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, vital signs, and laboratory results including viral diagnostics using PCR and mNGS. Among those hospitalized, we determined differences in treatment (antibiotics, antivirals, respiratory support) and outcomes (ICU admission, ICU interventions, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury). Findings: In a cohort of 316 patients, 33 (10\%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 31 patients, all without COVID-19, tested positive for another respiratory virus (16\%). Among patients with additional viral testing, no co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 were identified by PCR or mNGS. Patients with COVID-19 reported longer symptoms duration (median 7 vs. 3 days), and were more likely to report fever (82\% vs. 44\%), fatigue (85\% vs. 50\%), and myalgias (61\% vs 27\%); p\&lt;0.001 for all comparisons. Lymphopenia (55\% vs 34\%, p=0.018) and bilateral opacities on initial chest radiograph (55\% vs. 24\%, p=0.001) were more common in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were more often hospitalized (79\% vs. 56\%, p=0.014). Of 186 hospitalized patients, patients with COVID-19 had longer hospitalizations (median 10.7d vs. 4.7d, p\&lt;0.001) and were more likely to develop ARDS (23\% vs. 3\%, p\&lt;0.001). Most comorbidities, home medications, signs and symptoms, vital signs, laboratory results, treatment, and outcomes did not differ by COVID-19 status. Interpretation: While we found differences in clinical features of COVID-19 compared to other acute respiratory illnesses, there was significant overlap in presentation and comorbidities. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to the hospital, have longer hospitalizations and develop ARDS, and were unlikely to have co-existent viral infections. These findings enhance understanding of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison to other acute respiratory illnesses.

  abstract = "In recent years there has been tremendous progress towards deep
              molecular characterization of cell types using single cell
              transcriptome sequencing. Here we report a single cell
              transcriptomic atlas comprising nearly 500,000 cells from 24
              different human tissues and organs. In several instances multiple
              organs were analyzed from the same donor. Analyzing organs from
              the same individual controls for genetic background, age,
              environment, and epigenetic effects, and enables a detailed
              comparison of cell types that are shared between tissues. This
              resource provides a rich molecular characterization of more than
              400 cell types, their distribution across tissues, and detailed
              information about tissue specific variation in gene expression.
              We have used the fact that multiple tissues came from the same
              donor to study the clonal distribution of T cells between
              tissues, to understand the tissue specific mutation rate in B
              cells, and to analyze the cell cycle state and proliferative
              potential of shared cell types across tissues. Finally, we have
              also used this data to characterize cell type specific RNA
              splicing and how such splicing varies across tissues within an
              individual. One Sentence Summary We used single cell
              transcriptomics to create a molecularly defined phenotypic

  abstract    = "Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for cell
                 type identification but is not readily applicable to organisms
                 without well-annotated reference genomes. Of the approximately
                 10 million animal species predicted to exist on Earth, >99.9\%
                 do not have any submitted genome assembly. To enable scRNA-seq
                 for the vast majority of animals on the planet, here we
                 introduce the concept of `` k -mer homology,'' combining
                 biochemical synonyms in degenerate protein alphabets with
                 uniform data subsampling via MinHash into a pipeline called
                 Kmermaid. Implementing this pipeline enables direct detection
                 of similar cell types across species from transcriptomic data
                 without the need for a reference genome. Underpinning Kmermaid
                 is the tool Orpheum, a memory-efficient method for extracting
                 high-confidence protein-coding sequences from RNA-seq data.
                 After validating Kmermaid using datasets from human and mouse
                 lung, we applied Kmermaid to the Chinese horseshoe bat (
                 Rhinolophus sinicus ), where we propagated cellular
                 compartment labels at high fidelity. Our pipeline provides a
                 high-throughput tool that enables analyses of transcriptomic
                 data across divergent species' transcriptomes in a genome- and
                 gene annotation-agnostic manner. Thus, the combination of
                 Kmermaid and Orpheum identifies cell type-specific sequences
                 that may be missing from genome annotations and empowers
                 molecular cellular phenotyping for novel model organisms and
